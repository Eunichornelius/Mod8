        The story behind this picture... I was using <a href="https://gimp.org">Gimp</a> to make a meme while my daughter
        was watching a show on the TV next to me. She took an interest in what I was doing. This was a colaboration between
        her artistic vision and my obviously stellar, interstellar even? Image manipulation skills. I know that Adobe's 
        Photoshop is the defacto standard, but I've been on the GNU and Linux train for 20 years. Primarily I like Ubuntu
        because it requires less of an in depth knowledge of penguins. I'm more partial to 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPOISnUd7WE">badgers</a> myself...
